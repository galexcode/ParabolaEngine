Disclaimer: until the engine reaches alpha state, its API may change quite a few, and some features may still not be working as intended!

Here you can get the latest version of the source. Building projects available for VS2010 only, for now.

Once downloaded, you may open the solution file of vs2010, and it should compile right away to the Bin directory.

Besides the main library the engine produces, you will need the dependencies, which you can download from the github page.
Just care to download the dependencies for the latest version!

It should be already usable, but feel free to report any issues you may have.
